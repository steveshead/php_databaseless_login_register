# PHP Databaseless User Login and Registration System

Written in PHP this script users JSON to store user details. It has two user roles: admin and user.
I have setup one user for each with default values.

Role: Admin
Password: Admin123!

Role: User
Password: User123!

You can add, edit and delete through the JSON file, or users can register on the website itself.

The admin user can change the styling of the website through the "Site Settings" function in their dashboard.
This will change the styling across the website for all users.
